# Dronecode Community

This repo is an attempt at capturing the wider Dronecode community of
adopters/implementors and supporting organizations. The honest truth
about open source is that it's hard to measure adoption, and we don't
like guessing, instead we are taking a self-serve approach, and asking
orgs and individuals to add themselves to a list that applies to them.

This is the first effort we try, and we are encouraging feedback, we are
initially only going to capture a list of Adopting Organizations and
Community Consultants, in an effort to self identify and connect with
others, we know our community is big and it would be impossible to map
the whole thing, but we hope to be able capture at least a small
percentage of the most fierce adopters.

## Community Consultants

If you are interested in adding your consultancy, please see the list
found on this repo and add yourself there, here's a link for
convenience.

### How to Contribute

clearly identifies you as an employee. We won't accept PRs from people
trying to add companies they don't work at.
